<p>I am a recent graduate who is enthusiastic about programming, learning new technologies and finding solutions. I am looking for a Software Developer position where I can gain industry experience and contribute in a meaningful way. I have a strong foundation in Java, HTML, C++, C and Python.  Examples of my code can be found on Github (?https://github.com/SeanBeseler? ) and Hackerrank (?https://www.hackerrank.com/seanwbeseler?). I was also employed by Western Washington University as a teaching assistant for labs in C++ and Python and worked as a student researcher.</p>
